### üìù **Project Overview:**  
During my internship at NIT Calicut, I worked on the development of an advanced drone navigation and obstacle detection system tailored for agricultural applications. The main objectives of the project were to:

- **Enable autonomous navigation of drones** through agricultural terrains for various tasks such as mango plucking, pest detection in palm trees, and scaring away monkeys.  
- **Implement advanced pathfinding algorithms** like **RRT*** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to navigate obstacles efficiently and ensure safe, collision-free operation.
- **Leverage Lidar sensors** for real-time obstacle detection, ensuring the drones can safely navigate even in dynamic environments with both static and moving obstacles.

### üéØ **Project Objectives:**

1. **Mango Plucking Automation:**  
   - Develop a path planning algorithm to allow drones to navigate to mango trees, identify ripe mangoes using vision systems, and pluck them without damaging the fruit.  
   - Use **RRT*** for fast environment exploration and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** to calculate the most efficient route to pluck mangoes.

2. **Palm Tree Pest Detection:**  
   - Implement image processing algorithms for the drones to capture high-resolution images of palm trees to detect pests such as the red palm weevil.  
   - Process these images using **MATLAB** to identify early signs of pest infestations and send real-time alerts for pest control.

3. **Monkey Scaring System:**  
   - Develop an autonomous system for drones to patrol farms and scare away monkeys by emitting distress sounds or ultrasonic frequencies.  
   - Use **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** for path optimization to ensure efficient patrol routes without unnecessary overlap.

4. **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:**  
   - Use **Lidar sensors** for real-time obstacle detection and avoid collisions with both static and moving obstacles such as trees, power lines, and workers in the field.  
   - Implement a dynamic path recalibration system using **RRT*** and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** to continuously adjust the drone‚Äôs route as obstacles are detected.

### üõ† **Technologies and Algorithms Used:**

- **üîß ROS (Robot Operating System):**  
  For drone control, communication, and integration with sensors, ensuring smooth operation and coordination between drones.  

- **üì° Lidar Sensors:**  
  Used for real-time environmental scanning to detect obstacles (both static and dynamic), enabling safe navigation.  

- **üìä MATLAB:**  
  Employed for **image processing** and analysis of captured data for pest detection, including object recognition and anomaly detection in palm trees.  

- **üß† Pathfinding Algorithms:**  
  - **RRT*** (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) for fast exploration of the environment and collision-free path planning.  
  - **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** for calculating the shortest path, ensuring the most efficient route for task completion.

### üìπ **Video Demonstration:**

The project features a demonstration video where three drones are shown performing the following tasks autonomously:
- Navigating complex environments with obstacles.
- Detecting and avoiding both static and moving obstacles using Lidar.
- Plucking ripe mangoes, performing pest detection, and scaring away monkeys without collisions.
- Returning to the starting point safely by recalculating paths in real-time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **System Workflow:**

1. **Path Planning:**  
   The drone receives destination coordinates and plots a path using **RRT***, considering both static and dynamic obstacles.  
   
2. **Obstacle Detection:**  
   As the drone moves, Lidar sensors detect obstacles in its path. The system adjusts the route in real-time to avoid collisions.

3. **Pest Detection:**  
   The drone captures high-resolution images of palm trees, which are processed using **MATLAB** for pest detection. Alerts are sent to the operator if pests are detected.

4. **Monkey Scaring:**  
   The drone autonomously patrols the farm area, using **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** to find the most efficient patrol route and emits distress signals to scare away monkeys.

5. **Return Navigation:**  
   Upon completing the task, the drone recalculates the optimal return path, avoiding previously encountered obstacles and ensuring a collision-free return.
